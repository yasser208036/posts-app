# Story intake

Fill this template for each story you want planned. Keep it copy-paste-friendly: the planner reads **this file and the files in `attachments/`**, nothing else.

- Folder: `.squad/stories/posts/enhance-edit-post/intake.md`
- Binaries (screenshots, PDFs, exports): put them in `attachments/` next to this file and list them below.
- Do **not** rely on external links (tracker URLs, wiki, chat) — the planner cannot open them. Paste the content you want considered.

This is **not** an implementation prompt. It is the input to the plan-generation meta-prompt bundled with squad-kit (`generate-plan.md` in the installed package).

## Feature

- **Feature name (display):**
- **Feature slug (folder under `plans/`):** `posts`

## Tracker (metadata only)

- **Tracker type:** `none`
- **Work item id:** `` _(used in filenames and plan tables; fill manually if empty)_
- **Work item type:** ``
- **Status:** ``
- **Assignee:** ``
- **Labels:** ``

External tracker links are **not** followed by the planner. Keep the id for naming and traceability only.

## Title

_(Paste the work item title verbatim. Prefilled when `squad new-story` fetched from a tracker.)_

## Attachments

Place files in `attachments/` next to this `intake.md`, then list them here so the planner knows what to open.

| File (relative to this folder)  | What it is       |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| _(e.g. `attachments/flow.png`)_ | _(e.g. UX flow)_ |

_(Add rows per file. If none, write "None.")_
